# Codex Vitae 2019.01

This Codex Vitae, or “book of life”, [refs? - see “What is this?”] is a collection of my beliefs and concepts that inform my decisions and life. It is a work in constant flux; as my understanding changes, so will my beliefs. The main purpose of this document is to (1) pull my beliefs into the light where I can questions them more effectively and (2) to share philosophies, concepts, tools, and inspiration that have been helpful to me.
This document's purpose is to capture my beliefs about the universe, track how my thoughts change over time, and act an invitation to others to hold me accountable to my beliefs and commitments.

## Instructions
### If you are not janzeteachesit:
1. Read this with the understanding that you are different than me — the way I live my life is not the way you should live yours.
2. Read the Glossary for a general intro to my favorite ideas, starting with What is this?, then come back and read through the Beliefs that seem interesting to you.
3. Check the Changelog for updates since you last visited.
4. Consider creating your own Codex (here's a template, or see how I started mine back in 2012).

## As often as you can:
1. re-read your Type 3 beliefs (opinions).
2. As things happen in the world, revisit and edit this document to reflect your changing beliefs.
3. Archive the document annually.
4. Around your birthday every year, write a new yearly report.
Glossary
What is this?
Beliefs
The universe is a random place; I am okay with that (no “higher” or “guiding” power).
I am only halfway through life.  I will live for another 50 years (til I am at least 100).  
I will see a version of myself that is  - a digital copy(?) -.
The Internet
"if it is on the internet, it must be partly untrue, and have some questionable component"
Thinking
… is difficult; remembering is even more so.
Observances
I recognize the privilege within which I live my life

“Of course if we make good things, it is not only to the credit of science; it is also to the credit of the moral choice which led us to good work. Scientific knowledge is an enabling power to do either good or bad — but it does not carry instructions on how to use it. Such power has evident value — even though the power may be negated by what one does with it.
I learned a way of expressing this common human problem on a trip to Honolulu. In a Buddhist temple there, the man in charge explained a little bit about the Buddhist religion for tourists, and then ended his talk by telling them he had something to say to them that they would never forget — and I have never forgotten it. It was a proverb of the Buddhist religion:
To every man is given the key to the gates of heaven; the same key opens the gates of hell.
What then, is the value of the key to heaven? It is true that if we lack clear instructions that enable us to determine which is the gate to heaven and which the gate to hell, the key may be a dangerous object to use.
But the key obviously has value: how can we enter heaven without it?” - https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman
