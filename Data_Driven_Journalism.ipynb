        "\n",
        "### Why make our work transparent?\n",
        "* Encourage better documentation and code commenting, saving future you and others time when deciphering your code\n",

        "### Why make a Data Driven Journalism Cookiecutter?\n",
        "\n",
        "This [blog post](https://blog.ouseful.info/2017/01/25/data-journalism-units-on-github/) talks about tools in data journalism transparency with a great list toward the bottom with examples in practice. You'll see that there is no consensus as to how to share information, what information to share, and the format of that information, meaning that **each time you look at a project, you have to figure out where everything is, and what is available.**\n",
        "\n",
        "### Benefits to standardizing project structure for transparency\n",
        "* Less of a chore if how to organize and what to include has already been figured out\n",
        "* Documented projects with consistent structure are easier\n",
        "  - to refer back to,\n",
        "  - to train new journalists,\n",
        "  - for the public to explore and scrutinize\n",
        "\n",
        "The current repository tries to construct an organized, standardized \"Data Journalism Project\" structure. The directory structure is partly inspired by: [Reproducible Science Cookiecutter](https://github.com/mkrapp/cookiecutter-reproducible-science) by [Mario Krapp](https://github.com/mkrapp), and [Data Science Cookiecutter](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science) by [drivendata](https://github.com/drivendata).\n",
        "Data Journalism stories tend to be one-offs, and difficult or impossible to replicate by inputting data from a different city or industry, for example, so creating a new cookiecutter with a new organization structure seemed to make sense to me, rather than applying one of these existing projects directly. I also wanted to make it as lightweight as possible, since it is already going to feel like a lot of extra work to implement, until it becomes more familiar and routine.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Requirements\n",
        "This template was created with\n",
        "* cookiecutter 1.6.0\n",
        "* python 3.6\n",
        "\n",
        "Install `cookiecutter` via the command line with `pip install cookiecutter`\n",
        "\n",
        "For more on cookiecutter, go [here](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)\n",
        "\n",
        "Other versions of Python have not been tested.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are several ways to install python. [This link](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) also has details on installing a python interpreter. Because I do a lot of data analysis, I use python that comes with the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) which supplies lots of other awesome stuff for free, including Jupyter Notebook which is a popular tool for stepping people through a data analysis project.  \n",
        "\n",
        "A GitHub account, while not necessary to _use_ this cookiecutter, _is_ required to make your data journalism transparent and available for others to examine. For instructions on how to set up an account, go [here](https://github.com/).\n",
        "You will also need [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and/or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). If you're a git-beginner, I recommend the desktop. If you love command line, go ahead with git. \n",
        "\n",
        "## Usage\n",
        "To begin a new data-driven journalism project, open a terminal, navigate to where you want the project to reside, and type:\n",

        "`cookiecutter gh:jastark/cookiecutter-data-driven-journalism`\n",

        "\n",
        "- `full_name`: e.g. `Jennifer A. Stark` (this will be used to populate the `AUTHORS` file)\n",
        "- `email`: e.g. `jastark1@gmail.com` (will populate the `AUTHORS` file)\n",
        "- `github_username`: e.g. `JAStark` (will populate the `AUTHORS` file)\n",
        "- `project_name`: the name of the published story for easy cross-referencing, or, if you don't know it yet, something relatable. This text will populate the `README` file.\n",
        "- `project_slug`: leave empty. It will create a project directory named using `project_name` with underscores automatically added between words.\n",
        "- `short_description`: a short description of the Project. This text will populate the `README.md`\n",
        "- `ddj_cookiecutter_version`: leave empty.\n",
        "- `date`: leave as-is.\n",
        "\n",
