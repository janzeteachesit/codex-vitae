# Codex Vitae
This documents main purpose is to provide a place where I can:
  1. bring my beliefs into the light so that I can reflect on and question them more effectively, and
  2. share philosophies, concepts, tools, and inspiration that have been helpful to me.

My hopes for this document is that, through it I capture my beliefs about the universe, track how my thoughts change over time, and invite others to hold me accountable to my beliefs and commitments.
